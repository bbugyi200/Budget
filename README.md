# Personal Budget GUI (built on Tkinter)

After switching from Windows over to the Linux community, I found that my favorite budgeting software was no longer compatible with my system.

This project is my attempt at creating a platform independent budgeting program specifically designed to manage your money one pay-period at a time.

I would gladly accept outside contributions to this project. If you would like to contribute, please email me at bryan_bugyi@mymail.rcbc.edu.

## Running the Budget Program
This program requires that you have Python3 installed on your machine.

The program can be started by running `python start.py`.

##Questions or Comments?
If you have any comments or questions about this software, its dependencies, or how you can contribute, please email me at bryan_bugyi@mymail.rcbc.edu.
