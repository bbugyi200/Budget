# What is it?

Paycheck2Paycheck is a platform independent budgeting program specifically designed to manage your money one paycheck at a time.

# Why?

I am very enthusiastic about money management. But when it comes to budgeting software, I have never quite found the right match for me. In my eyes, they all seemed to be flawed in one way or the other. 

-----------------------------------------
##### I've tried smartphone apps that allow you to track your spendings as they happen

But what if I'm in a rush (aren't we all)? When using these apps, I always found myself going
through my receipts or online banking statments, and manually entering all of the day's (or week's) data at once. This was fine, but if I'm going to sit down at my computer and input all of this data at once, why not use an application on my computer? Why am I using my smartphone?
