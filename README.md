# Budget GUI (built on Tkinter)

After switching from Windows over to the Linux community, I found that my favorite budgeting software no longer worked.

This project is my attempt at creating a platform independent budgeting program specifically designed to manage your money one pay-period at a time.

I would gladly accept outside contributions to this project. If you would like to contribute, please email me at bryan_bugyi@mymail.rcbc.edu.

## Running the Budget Program
This program requires that you have Python3 installed on your machine.

Currently this program can be started simply by running the GUI.py script, although this will likely be changed shortly. 

##Questions or Comments?
If you have any comments or questions about this software, its dependencies, or how you can contribute, please email me at bryan_bugyi@mymail.rcbc.edu.
