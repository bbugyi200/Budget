# What is it?

Paycheck2Paycheck is a platform independent budgeting program specifically designed to manage your money one paycheck at a time.

# Why?

I am very enthusiastic about money management. But when it comes to budgeting software, I have never quite found the right match for me. In my eyes, they all seemed to be flawed in one way or the other. 

-----------------------------------------
##### I have tried smartphone apps that allow you to track your spendings as they happen.

But what if I'm in a rush (aren't we all)? When using these apps, I always found myself going
through my receipts or online banking statements, and manually entering all of the day's (or week's) data at once. This was fine, but if I'm going to sit down at my computer and input all of this data at once, why not use an application on my computer? Why am I using my smartphone?

##### I have tried powerful budgeting software that linked into my banking information and did all of the work for me.

Wow. This is great... At least, it seemed great. The problem here is that keeping track of my spendings now just became way <em>too</em> easy. If I don't force myself to look at all of my receipts (or online statements) on a regular basis, my mind simply does not register them. Sure, my spendings are being <em>tracked</em>, but is this software really making me more aware of my spending habits? Not really. Not for me at least. This is especially true when most of my transactions have been made via credit or debit cards. I think it is imperative that I review these expenses myself, otherwise it can be all too easy to just keep spending away and deal with the consequences later. 

##### I have tried creating my own spreadsheets and customizing them to track my spendings

Now this I liked a lot at first. But it was all to difficult to change the way the spreadsheet operated. And when I switched operating systems, I found that those spreadsheets, that I had spent hours customizing to my liking, no longer worked the way they should. Now I'll admit, spreadsheets are an OK option for your personal finances; however, they can be way too much work and become less and less reliable the more complicated they become.
