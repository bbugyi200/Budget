===== Vision =====
* So many people are forced to live paycheck to paycheck, but it doesn't have to be difficult. 

* Linking to your bank account is NOT going to help you. You need to manually input data, so you
  are forced to become more aware of your spending habits. 

* This program can help you save big by starting small. 

* While most projects think of the ideal customer as one who trys a product and continues to use
  it forever, we are different. We want to teach you how to live P2P so, one day, you won't have to.

* Explain version and how to download program.
